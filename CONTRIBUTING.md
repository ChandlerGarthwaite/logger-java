## Coding Conventions

Our code style is whatever IntelliJ IDEA does by default, with the exception of allowing lines up to 130 characters.
If you don't use IDEA, that's ok, but your code may get reformatted.

## Git Workflow 

Initial setup: 

```
git clone git@github.com:resurfaceio/logger-java.git resurfaceio-logger-java
cd resurfaceio-logger-java
```

Running unit tests:

```
mvn test
```

Committing changes:

```
git add -A
git commit -m "#123 Updated readme"       (123 is the GitHub issue number)
git pull --rebase                         (avoid merge bubbles)
git push origin master
```

## Release Process

Publish snapshot build to [mavenrepo](https://github.com/resurfaceio/mavenrepo) for integration testing:

```
mvn install
(merge changes .m2 to resurfaceio/mavenrepo)
```

All [integration tests](https://github.com/resurfaceio/logger-tests) must pass before proceeding.

Configure environment variables (in `.bash_profile`):

```
export JAVA_HOME="/Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/jdk1.8.0_131.jdk/Contents/Home"
export GPG_TTY=$(tty)
```

Configure Maven settings (in `.m2/settings.xml`):

```
<settings>
  <profiles>
    <profile>
      <id>ossrh</id>
      <activation>
        <activeByDefault>true</activeByDefault>
      </activation>
      <properties>
        <gpg.keyname>[public-key-id]</gpg.keyname>
      </properties>
    </profile>
  </profiles>
  <servers>
    <server>
      <id>ossrh</id>
      <username>resurfaceio</username>
      <password>[ask-rob]</password>
    </server>
  </servers>
</settings>
```

Push artifacts to [Maven Central](https://search.maven.org/):

```
(remove -SNAPSHOT from end of version string, in pom.xml and BaseLogger.java)
git add -A
git commit -m "Update version to 1.x.x"
mvn deploy
```

Log into `oss.sonatype.org` and close/release the latest staging repository.

Tag release version:

```
git tag v1.x.x
git push origin master --tags
```

Start the next version by incrementing the version number and adding `-SNAPSHOT`,
in `pom.xml` and `Baselogger.java`.

## Errata

Running `mvn deploy` and `mvn install` from IntelliJ will not prompt for gpg passphrase.
Instead these fail with an error (`gpg: signing failed: No such file or directory`).
Copy the maven command generated by IntelliJ and paste this into a terminal window, and you'll be prompted for the passphrase.
Running `deploy` from IntelliJ will work after the passphrase has been entered successfully.
(I tried setting `-Dgpg.passphrase` and couldn't get this to work)
